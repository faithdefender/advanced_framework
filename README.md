Sharing an advanced system prompt for others out there that have knee pain or tight leg muscles or just need a list of good stretches, this will give you an excellent list of stretches from any advanced LLM such as Grok, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, etc.

Some of the instruction is hardcoded. All you have to do is edit the USER INPUT section for your own condition and copy and paste the entire prompt and run it!
